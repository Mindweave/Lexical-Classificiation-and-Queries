# Templates Overview

## Description
These are templates used for many backend operations used in the functioning of the ScrapBook Flow. Templates can also be useful for users to create a quick pre-defined structure to notes.

For user templates to be inserted, use the "Insertable Templates" folder. These are templates that can be inserted using the button in the toolbar at the bottom of currently active markdown files.
