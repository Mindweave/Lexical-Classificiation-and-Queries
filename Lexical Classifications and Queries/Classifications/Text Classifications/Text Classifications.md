# Text Classifications Overview

## Description
This folder contains all text classifications that are used to classify markdown files. These can then be grouped into your vocabulary which is used in the queries to identify topics in notes in the way that YOU express these topics. 

The text classifications are flexible in the type of classifications they perform. They can classify using a single word or more complex patterns of letters such as a word containing a series of letters, starting with letters, ending with letters, as well as across multiple words or multiple text patterns in the markdown file. This flexibility comes from using Regular Expressions (REGEX) to classify text using patterns. 

Text classifications will be used from anywhere inside this "Classifications/Text Classifications" folder. You can change the folder structure where text classifications are contained within this folder to suit your needs.
