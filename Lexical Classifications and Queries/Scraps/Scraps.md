# Scraps Overview

## Description
This folder contains any notes or files. They are called scraps as being a small part of your scrapbook. Individually each file represents a part of your life. 

Regardless of how important each file is alone (from PHD documents to grocery lists to random thoughts throughout the day), they all become important when brought together by linking and searches. When brought together the files become points of data representing a more holistic view of who you are, who you've been, and can help you determine who you're going to be.
