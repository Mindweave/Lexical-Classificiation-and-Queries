- Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be

- Whatever you are, be a good one

- I am a slow walker, but I never walk back
 
- There are no bad pictures; that's just how your face looks sometimes
 
- Those who look for the bad in people will surely find it
 
- I don't like that man. I must get to know him better.
