### Porsche 917
A Porsche with dripping with futuristic style while still keeping the 1960s aesthetic. Retrofuturism at its finest.

### Bentley Continental GT
A luxurious powerhouse. Capable of a smooth ride (evidently) anywhere in the world

### McLaren Senna
Essentially a Hotwheels car brought to life for a hefty price

### Lincoln Navigator 2022
Looks comfortable. Has all the new capabilities of a modern SUV. Good miles per gallon. As far as cars go, it's alright, alright, alright.
