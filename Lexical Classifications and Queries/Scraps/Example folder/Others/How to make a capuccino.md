[Perfect Cappuccino Recipe](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-cappuccinos-766116)
## Intro
A light, foamy cappuccino is a favorite drink for many coffee lovers. Once you acquire two basic barista skills (pulling shots and foaming milk), you can learn how to make a cappuccino yourself.

A cappuccino is an Italian coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with equal parts double espresso, steamed milk, and steamed milk foam on top. Cream may be used instead of milk. It is typically smaller in volume than a latte, and has a thicker layer of microfoam. Espresso is typically made with dark roast coffee and ground finely.

In Italian, cappuccino means "little cap," which aptly describes the head of foamed milk that sits atop the drink's espresso base. According to history, it also allegedly derives from the dress of the Capuchin order of monks. With their iconic brown hooded cowls and shaved heads, Capuchin monks are a pretty close human resemblance to the ring of crema and white foam that tops the classic beverage.

Microfoam is frothed/steamed milk in which the bubbles are so small and numerous that they are unseen but make the milk lighter and thicker. When the espresso is poured correctly, the microfoam will remain partly on top of the mug, as well as mix well with the rest of the cappuccino.

A cappuccino is usually made using an espresso machine. The double espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine's steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of milk foam, which can be decorated with art made with the same milk, or simply sprinkled with cinnamon or cocoa powder. 

## Steps to make the cappuccino
1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Place the water into the boiler of your espresso machine
3. Place the 2 tablespoons (2 shots) of ground coffee into the portafilter.
4. Tamp (press) the coffee down using a tamper. Do this 2 to 3 times to make sure the grounds are packed tightly.
5. Place the portafilter into your espresso machine's group head and lock it in place by turning it to the right.
6. Place a demitasse cup or the glass carafe that came with your espresso machine under the group head and pull the shot for 23 to 30 seconds, or until 2 ounces of espresso is yielded. Typically, there is a lever, switch, or button to start this process. 
7. Once the shot is pulled, foam the milk.

## Steps to foam milk
1. Place the milk into either a glass measuring cup or a small metal pitcher.
2. Insert the steam wand into the container with the milk, just under the surface of the milk.
3. Engage the steam wand on your espresso machine. (You may need to read your espresso machine's manual for this, as each espresso maker is a little different.)
4. Make sure to keep the tip of the wand toward the side of the container. This will create a vortex with the milk.
5. Move the container higher, lower, closer, then further so that the steam wand can incorporate the air into the milk, making the foam. The bubbles should get smaller and smaller as you do this.
6. Once the milk has foamed to double its size, turn the steam wand off.
7. Top the espresso with foamed milk right after foaming. When initially poured, cappuccino is only espresso and foam, but the liquid milk quickly settles out of the foam to create the (roughly) equal parts foam, steamed milk, and espresso for which cappuccino is known.
